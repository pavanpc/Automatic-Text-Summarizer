For some odd reason, whenever I visit Norcal, I have to eat deep dish pizza. I'm sure nostalgia has a lot to do with it since I tasted my first decent (actually, more like fantastic) deep dish pizza during my years in Berkeley. My family was in San Francisco on a weekend trip and I really wanted my family to experience deep dish pizza so I was VERY happy when I found out that Patxi's was walking distance away from our hotel. It was my first time here so I didn't know, but I highly suggest you call in your order To-Go if you live in the area because the wait here is insane. My family and I waited about an hour before we were seated. Please note that the dish dish takes about 30-45 mins just to bake in the oven, so make sure you actually order your pizza before you sit. It will save you a lot of time. My family and I ordered our pizza before we sat, and we only had to wait about an additional 15 minutes after we were seated for our food.

We ordered their Patxi's Special pizza. It comes with garlic-fennel sausage, sliced mushrooms, green peppers, and yellow onion. It was worth the wait. It was insanely delicious. A great combination of toppings and not too salty. It wasn't as greasy as some deep dish pizzas tend to be and not too saucy. I also really liked the fact that they put the perfect amount of cheese because there actually is such a thing as too much cheese on a pizza. We shared a large pizza between 5 people and it was the perfect amount. The only negative besides the wait was that the service is a little slow though so keep that in mind and it is VERY loud in the restaurant. You're gonna be talking pretty loudly to each other the whole time but it might be worth it for some great pizza. 4/5
